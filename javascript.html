alert('This is the time when people have retired and do not earn a regular income from their jobs as they did in the preceding decades. This is also an affirmation to the fact that your financial plan must focus on maintaining the lifestyle that you have and having provisions for unforeseen contingencies. As a retiree, your risk appetite should be at the lowest when compared to your regular income earning days. Even the risk profile for your investments should be conservative with your asset classes having an approximate cash exposure of 80 percent and a debt exposure of 20 percent.As is evident, your expenses and your goals change with age and your investment objectives shift as well. When you are starting your career you can afford to take higher risks to garner higher returns, while on nearing retirement the dependence on risk diminishes. This is a pivotal transition that must be planned and followed with care to achieve a secure financial future.');

The lifestyle, spending habits and financial commitments are different for these individuals as compared to those in their 30s and 40s. Major percentage of this group has student loans to repay, and a fast moving lifestyle to keep up with. With the promise of regular income, the risk appetite of the this age group is the highest which allows them the opportunity to be highly aggressive with their financial risk profile. Since you are just at the start of your earning path, with the potential to scale higher, you can afford the luxury of having a major portion of your asset class invested in equity. 75 percent equity investment along with an equal portion of debt and cash investments of 13 percent would be an ideal allocation. Given that this may be the very first time investing for most people in this age group, it is important to understand that investments in equity carries market risk and must be navigated carefully.

This is good news as it allows you to have an appetite for risky investments with an aggressive approach. With the scale of your income and its regularity, you have the bandwidth to allocate a good portion of your investment, about 60 percent, towards equity investments while the remaining 25 and 15 percent can be distributed between debt and cash respectively.

Your appetite for risk in this age bracket drops down to medium and even though you must continue to invest, your approach must be that of moderate aggression. While equity still remains the major occupant of your portfolio, its allocation must be brought down to a safe level of 40 percent, while at the same time you may increase your debt  investments to 25 percent and cash to about 35 percent. This is substantial change from your previous allocations as now your focus is on taking lesser risk and accepting the moderate returns while ensuring the safety of your funds through higher debt investment.');

An approximate allocation of 45 percent cash, 35 percent debt and 20 percent equity would be of ideal scenario as your risk profile will be moderate with a low risk appetite.');
